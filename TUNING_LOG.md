# Tuning Log

Do not add Phase 2 tuning entries until the runtime gate in
`PHASE2_RUNTIME_VALIDATION_RUNBOOK.md` has enough evidence to justify a change.
Baseline findings remain in `PHASE2_BASELINE_VALIDATION.md`.

## 2026-07-01 - Phase 1 Audit

No gameplay tuning changes were made.

Actions:

- Created audit branch `openclaw/azeroth-progression-audit-2026-07-01`.
- Created live backup `/srv/azerothcore/backups/2026-07-01-204201-pre-progression-audit`.
- Inspected local repository state.
- Inspected live containers, configs, logs, module binary linkage, and selected database state.
- Wrote baseline documentation.

Rollback:

- No gameplay rollback required.
- To remove this audit doc pass, revert the documentation commit once created.

## 2026-07-01 - Phase 2 Read-Only Validation

No gameplay tuning changes were made.

Actions:

- Added a read-only live validation script at `tools/warwid/run-live-phase2-readonly-audit.sh`.
- Ran the script against the live database.
- Recorded AHBot baseline: `250` bot-owned auctions, all quality `1`, total buyout `286.13g`, `0` vendor-resale candidates.
- Recorded Individual Progression baseline: `18` hidden progression quests and `2381` condition rows.
- Confirmed `SOAP.Enabled = 0`, `Ra.Enable = 0`, and `Console.Enable = 1`.
- Confirmed pseudo-TTY console attach works for `server info`.
- Attempted `.ab getoffset` from the bare worldserver console. This restarted `ac-worldserver`; the container returned to running state with Docker `RestartCount = 1`.

Rollback:

- No config or database rollback required.
- No live files were intentionally changed.
- Do not run AutoBalance commands from the bare console again until the defect is isolated.

## 2026-07-01 - Phase 2 Live SSH Recheck

No gameplay tuning changes were made.

Actions:

- Installed the approved EC2 private key in the local Linux SSH path with
  `0600` permissions.
- Revalidated SSH access to the live host.
- Confirmed `ac-database` was healthy and `ac-authserver`/`ac-worldserver` were
  running the deployed `master-*` images with Docker restart count `0`.
- Re-ran the read-only Phase 2 audit and AHBot bracket audit against the live
  database.
- Recorded AHBot baseline: `250` bot-owned auctions, all quality `1`, total
  buyout `361.86g`, `0` risky quality/level auctions, and `0` vendor-resale
  candidates.
- Confirmed Individual Progression baseline still has `18` hidden progression
  quests and `2381` condition rows.

Rollback:

- No config or database rollback required.
- No live files were intentionally changed.

## 2026-07-01 - EMBER-62 Docker Build Patch Application

No live gameplay tuning changes were made.

Actions:

- Updated `apps/docker/Dockerfile` to copy `patches/` into the build stage.
- Applied `patches/warwid/mod-autobalance-console-null-session.patch` during the Docker build before CMake configures modules.
- Verified the patch applies cleanly with `git -C modules/mod-autobalance apply --check ../../patches/warwid/mod-autobalance-console-null-session.patch`.
- Built Docker target `build` successfully with:
  - `DOCKER_CONFIG=<temporary empty config> docker build -f apps/docker/Dockerfile --target build -t warwidcore-autobalance-console-fix:build .`
- Build result: CMake configured all five Warwid modules, compiled patched `mod-autobalance/src/ABCommandScript.cpp`, linked `worldserver`, and exported image `warwidcore-autobalance-console-fix:build`.

Rollback:

- Revert the Dockerfile patch-application step.
- The preserved patch file can remain as documentation, or be removed if a module fork/upstream fix replaces it.

## 2026-07-01 - EMBER-39 AHBot Bracket Audit

No gameplay tuning changes were made.

Actions:

- Added a read-only AHBot bracket audit at `tools/warwid/phase2_ahbot_bracket_audit.sql`.
- Added runner `tools/warwid/run-live-ahbot-bracket-audit.sh`.
- Ran the audit against the live database.
- Recorded `250` bot-owned auctions with total buyout `298.11g`.
- Recorded all `250` auctions as quality `1`.
- Recorded `0` risky quality/level auctions.
- Recorded `0` vendor-resale candidates and `0.0000g` possible vendor profit.
- Recorded level-bracket mix: `40` cosmetic/trade/low, `88` level 1-19, `28` level 20-39, `29` level 40-59, `17` level 60-69, `12` level 70-79, `5` level 80, `31` no required level.
- Recorded class mix led by consumables (`62`, `221.44g`) and glyphs (`62`, `12.75g`), with only `23` trade-good auctions.

Rollback:

- No config or database rollback required.
- To remove the audit tooling, revert the commit that adds the two `tools/warwid` files.
